## Get Started
To run this example, you must first instantiate the dependencies in the `Project.toml`. Note - the example currently adds the latest CES from the Julia registry.

Next, you must extract the `.zip` file and ensure that `exp_name` matches the directory name of the unzipped data directory. Then run the main file `uq_for_edmf.jl`.

Approx time for completion:
- exp_name = ent-det-calibration: 45 mins
- exp-det-tked-tkee-stab-calibtaion: 80mins
