  Apply fixes described in full-code-review/<date>/fix-prompts/<ID>-<slug>.md
  files — the self-contained fix prompts produced by the math-auditor skill
  after an adversarial mathematical review — and, once a fix is verified, mark
  the finding as resolved in the parent review.md so the review stays a living
  record of what's fixed vs. still open. Use this skill whenever the user asks
  to fix, implement, or apply a finding by its ID (e.g. "fix C1", "apply the
  M7 fix", "implement the fix-prompts for the likelihood-informed processor"),
  asks to work through a review's fix-prompts/README.md in order, or
  references a full-code-review directory at all. Trigger even if the user
  doesn't say "fix-prompt" explicitly — any request to act on findings from an
  existing math/code review report qualifies.

# Fix-Prompt Applier

Counterpart to **math-auditor**: math-auditor produces a review plus a
directory of self-contained fix prompts; this skill consumes them, usually in
a later session (or a smaller model) with none of the audit's context. Every
fix prompt was written assuming exactly that — treat each one as the full
brief, not a pointer into a conversation you don't have.

## Workflow

### 1. Locate and read before touching any code

- Find the fix-prompt file(s) for the requested ID(s) under
  `full-code-review/**/fix-prompts/`. IDs are stable (`C1…` critical, `M1…`
  major, `m1…` minor, `h1…` hygiene, `G1…` grouped-minor).
- If `fix-prompts/README.md` exists, read it first: it gives the recommended
  application order, flags same-file prompts that must be sequenced together,
  and — importantly — names which fixes **intentionally change numerical
  results**. That last part matters at verification time: a regression test
  that starts failing after such a fix isn't a new bug, it was pinned to the
  old, wrong behavior.
- Read each fix-prompt file **in full**. They follow a fixed shape (File /
  Problem / Required change / Do not / Verify) precisely so nothing besides
  the prompt itself is needed — don't skim just the required-change line and
  move on.

### 2. Apply

- **Confirm the "bug" is actually a bug before changing behavior.** Some
  findings turn out, on inspection, to be silent-but-correct-by-design rather
  than a defect — e.g. a finding once claimed a per-output-dimension scalar
  backend "silently" dropped cross-output noise correlations that its
  vector-output sibling kept; in fact that backend fits one fully independent
  model per output dimension, so there's no joint likelihood anywhere in it
  for a correlation to live in — `Diagonal` is the only structure it can
  represent, not a lossy shortcut. Check the fix-prompt's own "Do not" section
  first: the original audit often already made this call (a line like
  "diagonal-only is the correct capability of ... models" is your signal that
  the right fix is a warning or docstring, not a behavior change). If the
  prompt is silent or ambiguous on this, or the code has drifted since the
  audit, re-derive it yourself from the current source. Getting this wrong
  runs in both directions: "fixing" correct architecture changes behavior
  that shouldn't change, while assuming everything is by-design lets a real
  bug ship as a warned-around silence instead of an actual fix.
- Find the offending code by the function name and snippet quoted in the
  prompt. Line numbers drift between the audit and the fix session — treat
  them as hints, not anchors; the quoted snippet is what actually locates it.
- Make exactly the described change. Read the "Do not" guardrails literally —
  they exist because the prompt's author already considered the tempting
  adjacent change (a broader refactor, an API change, "fixing" a neighboring
  function too) and rejected it. A fix prompt is deliberately narrow, usually
  one finding in ~40 lines; don't expand scope while you're in there.
- When several fix prompts touch the same file (e.g. two findings in the same
  function, or in the same processor), read all of them before editing any of
  them, and land the edits together so the file is mathematically consistent
  at every intermediate step — don't let one fix's change invalidate another
  prompt's line references or assumptions about the surrounding code.
- If a prompt's description seems ambiguous, or seems to contradict what the
  current code actually does (code drifts between the audit and the fix
  session too), re-read the source and re-derive the math yourself rather than
  guessing. The prompt is the best available hint; the source is ground truth.
- **Keep fix-prompt IDs out of shipped code.** `C1`, `M7`, `m5`, `h3`, `G4`,
  and the like are the review's internal shorthand, legible only next to
  `review.md`'s legend — which the next reader of this source file (a
  teammate, or the smaller model this skill is written for) won't have open.
  Never write an ID into a source comment, docstring, or test/testset name,
  including any test you add to satisfy step 3's Verify section; describe
  what behavior is being fixed or pinned in plain, self-contained English
  instead. `review.md` and the fix-prompts themselves are the only place
  these IDs belong — that's what step 4's Status notes are for.
- **Comment tersely.** One line pointing at the non-obvious invariant is
  usually enough; the fuller story — what was wrong, the derivation, prior
  failed attempts — belongs in review.md's Status note, which has the room
  for it and is where a reader goes for depth. Reach for more than one line
  only when the constraint genuinely resists being said in one, and even then
  keep it short: a source file is where code is read next to, not where a
  fix's history is told.
- **New exported methods get a docstring, not a comment above them.** Match
  the convention neighboring exported functions in the same file already use
  (check a couple of nearby examples — this package's convention is
  `$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)` via DocStringExtensions) rather than inventing a new
  style. Don't also place a comment block above the method: the docstring is
  the documentation, and a comment duplicating it is redundant on top of
  fighting the terseness point above.

### 3. Verify

- Run, or add, exactly the test or invariant the prompt's "Verify" section
  names — this is the thing that pins the fix and stops the bug from silently
  coming back.
- If a pre-existing test fails after the change, check the README (or the
  prompt itself) for a note that this fix intentionally changes numerical
  results before treating the failure as a regression. If it's flagged, update
  the test's expected/reference value to the correct analytic or numerical
  value the prompt derives — don't revert the fix to make the old value pass
  again.
- Beyond the named test, run the package's broader relevant test suite (the
  module's test file at minimum) to catch collateral breakage the narrow
  Verify step wouldn't show.

### 4. Update `review.md` so it stays a living record

A fix-prompt is a snapshot of a bug at audit time. Once it's fixed and
verified, the parent review should say so — otherwise the next reader
(including a future instance of you, or the smaller model this skill was
written for) re-discovers a "bug" that's already closed.

- Find `review.md` next to the fix-prompts directory (`../review.md` relative
  to `fix-prompts/`, i.e. `full-code-review/<date>/review.md`). If it doesn't
  exist — e.g. someone handed you a fix-prompt file on its own — skip this
  step rather than erroring; there's nothing to update.
- Get today's date from the shell (`date +%F`), the same way math-auditor
  dates its report directories. Don't recall or guess a date from memory —
  it's cheap to get exactly right and confusing to get wrong.
- In the **summary table**, mark the fixed finding's row, e.g. append
  `— FIXED (<date>)` to its Verdict cell. Reuse the Verdict column rather than
  inventing a new one, unless the table already has a Status column or the
  Verdict cell would get unreadably cluttered.
- In the finding's own detailed section (under Critical/Major/Minor/Hygiene
  findings), append — don't rewrite — a short status note directly below the
  existing text:
  ```
  **Status**: Fixed <date> — <1-3 sentences: what changed, `file:line`, which
  test/invariant now pins it>. Applied via the fix-prompt-applier skill.
  ```
  Leave the original finding text (evidence, math, failure scenario) exactly
  as it is — that's the historical record of what was wrong and how it was
  found. review.md is meant to double as an audit trail: a reader should see
  both what the bug was and that it's now closed, without losing either.
- If a single pass fixed several findings (e.g. two in the same file), update
  all of their rows and sections together so the document reflects the whole
  batch consistently, not a half-updated intermediate state.

### 5. Check whether other open prompts just went stale

A fix can change shared code — a struct's fields, a function's signature, a
calling convention — that some *other*, still-open fix-prompt in the same
directory also quotes. If so, that prompt's line numbers and snippets are now
misleading in exactly the way step 2 already tells you to watch out for in
the prompt you're actively applying — except the next person to pick up that
other prompt won't have this session's context to notice it. A fix-prompt
only saves time if it's trustworthy; a stale one costs the next session (or
model) the same rediscovery work you just did.

Resist the urge to fully rewrite that other prompt, though, even if you can
see exactly what changed. Re-deriving whether its claimed bug is still real
against the new code is an audit judgment call — the same adversarial
re-derivation math-auditor does, not a byproduct of applying an unrelated
fix — and overwriting its Problem/Required-change text would destroy the
historical record of what the bug looked like at audit time, for the same
reason step 4 appends review.md status rather than rewriting a finding.

So, cheaply:
- Grep the fix-prompts directory for other prompts whose `File`/`Where`
  section names a file you just edited.
- Skip any already marked fixed (check `review.md` or the prompt itself).
- Of the rest, check whether the specific function, struct, or snippet *that
  prompt quotes* was actually touched by your edit — not just "same file".
  Most fixes are narrow and won't overlap with what another prompt cares
  about; this should usually turn up nothing, and that's fine.
- Where there's real overlap, append (don't rewrite) a short note to that
  prompt:
  ```
  **Note (updated <date>)**: the code this prompt describes may have moved —
  <what changed, e.g. "the sampler struct fields this prompt references were
  renamed in the <ID> fix on <date>">. Re-verify the current source before
  trusting this prompt's line numbers/snippets; do not assume they still match.
  ```

### 6. Report back

For each fix ID applied, state: what changed and where (`file:line`), which
test/invariant now pins it, whether any existing test's expected value needed
updating (and why, citing the README/prompt note that justified it), whether
`review.md` was updated (or why it was skipped), and whether any other
fix-prompts were flagged as stale (name them, or say none needed it — don't
pad this line when step 5 found nothing). Keep this compact — one or two
lines per ID — the point is a scannable record of what's fixed and what now
guards it, not a re-explanation of the math (that's already in the review and
the prompt). If step 2's design-intent check found a finding to be
correct-by-design, say so plainly rather than reporting it the same way as a
behavior fix — the reader needs to know a warning/docstring is the whole fix,
not a partial one.

## Improving this skill

After applying fixes, offer: "Would you like to improve the
**fix-prompt-applier** skill itself using skill-creator? You can share
suggestions, or I can analyze this session — where a prompt was ambiguous,
where scope crept, whether verification actually caught anything — to refine
the skill for next time."
